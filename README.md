FastAPI-AuthControl
===================
Authentication running on FastAPI-Users

Installation
------------

### Install with `pip`

```bash
pip install fastapi-authcontrol
```

### Add the fork as a dependency
This package uses a fork of the [fastapi-users]() package not main one. You'll have to install
 this as a separate `pip` command since I haven't found a way as of yet to include it in the
  *install_requires* section of this package.
  
 


Features
